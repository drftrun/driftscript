 * operates on surviving the edit. Those are §48's steps 1 and 5 through 8, and this page is where

 * **The state object is created once, outside the reload path.** That is the whole demonstration:
 * editing `pulse.drs` swaps the function while `state` keeps the phase it had reached, so the
 * circle does not jump. A page that recreated state on reload would show the same picture and prove
